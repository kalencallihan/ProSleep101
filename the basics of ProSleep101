This is a spin off of the Beddit 3 Smart Sleep Monitor. My goal is to have the ProSleep101 be a two piece set and each user has their own individual code. This code can be given to doctors if the user wishes. Essentially,one piece is a flat device that is charged via an outlet and lays flat underneath the comforter of where the user is sleeping. It will track their heart rate, breathing sounds, restlessness, and overall amount of time slept. The second device or "monitor" will be placed bedside and as long as the code is put on it the user will be able to wake up and check the monitor on how their sleep went the following night and so would their doctor.
